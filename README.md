### Hello.

I am a student majoring in **computer science** at Peking University, China. I also take a double degree in **pure mathematics**.

My main interests are:

+ Computer architecture & compilers
+ Software-hardware codesign & domain specific hardware
+ Distributed systems & cloud computing
+ Algebra & number theory & cryptography
+ Theoretical computer science

I haven't yet had much experience with these areas. I am currently learning about operating systems and computer architecture, and I am trying to get involved in some basic research in computer systems.
